Intro
The primary goal of Permasylum is to create a mental health facility with permaculture farm land and eco-comunity. I envisige a permaculture farm run and maintained by the service users. The facility should be as self sufficient as possible. Staffing should be to a minimum as much as possible. Encorging service users to maintain the facility and care for other service users as much as possible. By fostering a caring and supportive comunity that empowers residents to care for and maintain it as much as possible.

over view
The facility should have a capacity of 300 people. Roughly this will entail a plot of land of 600 acres. As with the madlove project the land will be devided in to 4 areas, residential, communal, recreational and agricultural.
For the  most part the residential area should be soley for rest/sleep.
The communal areas should comprise of a library, school, work shop, plaza, kitchen and cantean.
The recreational area should include a park for sports and leasure, area for swimming, paths for running and walking and finaly nooks for private meeting and contemplation.

There should be some degree of consideration to the dispersion of the areas

The residential area should be kept to one area, minimizing the perimiter to area ratio as much as possible. It should only contain small amoints of agricultural land and paths.
The communal area should be adjasent to the residential area. Split in to 2 locations. The school and library should be together and seperate from the other communial areas. In a tranqil area. The other facilities should be kept together. When considered together the residential and communal areas should have minamised perimiter to area ratio

The 

the residential area should be as focused to one area as possible. adjasent should be the bulk of the comunial areas. primarily the work shop, plaza, kitchen and cantean. however the library and school may be best sueted to a more removed area.
